<h1>Enxhi's Counter 🧮👩‍💻 </h1>

I created this super easy counter as my first Javascript project to practice a little!
<br>
This is the view of my project:

<br>
<br>
When you first click any of those buttons, instead of the image, you'll se a number: it depends on the button you press first.<br><br>

Here is the link widh which you can reach the page to try my counter:  https://mrizienxhi.github.io/counter/
<br><br>

When you click on the Plus button, the number in the middle increase; <br>

When you click on the Minus button, the number in the middle decrese; <br>

When you click on the Reset button, the number become 0.

I wanted to put some of my personality on this project by using colours and details that I like!
<br>
For example I used 3 kind of cursors as you can see here below: <br> <br>
I used this corsor: ![image](https://github.com/mrizienxhi/counter/assets/99075038/6f1676f8-6db1-408b-b83b-bbda401df8e9) outside the counter, where the background is colorfull; <br><br>
I used this cursor: ![image](https://github.com/mrizienxhi/counter/assets/99075038/bd0009a1-e174-4028-8dfc-86f7e2b178ba) inside the counter, where the background is white, to have some contrast;<br><br>
Last, but not least, I used this pointer: ![image](https://github.com/mrizienxhi/counter/assets/99075038/02b6c05c-1c48-4eee-949a-4d8b51551434) (which is quite similat to the other two pointers) when the cursor slides over the buttons!

That's all, thank's for reading 🙏 hope you'll appreciate my project even if it's a beginner level 🧑‍💻☺️
